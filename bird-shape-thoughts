Bird shapes and actions:

1. Full bird shapes where their motion comes from flapping their wings.
  -In this case the actions a bird takes could be wing movements.
  -The birds would have to learn to fly as well as learn the behavior we're looking for
  -difficult to make the force/torque equations
  -difficult to simulate if the air around a bird is affected by the birds near them
  -most physically accurate

2. Full bird shape with no wing flapping
  -assume birds don't change their shape, they always have wings outstretched
  -assume the birds already know how to push themselves in some direction and rotate themselves
  -actions could be a 3D force and torque
  -loses a lot of physical accuracy compared to the wing flapping birds
  -doesn't seem to add much more than the no wings version, unless we also
    simulate how birds affect the air near other birds

3. No wings
  -assume birds know how to move themselves in any direction and assume they take
    aerodynamics into account when they move
  -Actions are just a 3D force
  -torque equation wouldn't be needed anymore
  -not a very physically accurate simulation
  -super simple and still lets us see bird decision making based on motion of other birds
